## What is StatefulJ?

[StatefulJ](http://www.statefulj.org) is an open source Java based Finite State Machine along with a Spring based integrated framework.


## Why should I use StatefulJ in my Application?

Modern day applications have to manage and orchestrate requests and events from many sources: REST and SOAP APIs, message queueing systems, internal events, page requests, etc...

Handling concurrency and reliably updating Application state becomes a major challenge without the proper framework.  StatefulJ integrates State Machines into your Application providing you the ability to easily define and manage your state models.

## What does StatefulJ provide?

StatefulJ provides the following "packages":

* **StatefulJ FSM:** A dependency free, Finite State Machine implementation with support for non-determinstic Transitions.
* **StatefulJ Persistence:** A set of persistence support (JPA and Mongo) which works with the FSM library to persist your Stateful objects.
* **StatefulJ Framework:** A framework built off StatefulJ FSM, StatefulJ Persistence and Spring Data to easily integrate State Machines into your Application.

## How do I get started?

If you just want the Core FSM, then follow these instructions

If you want to use the framework, then go here
